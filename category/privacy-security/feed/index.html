<h3 id="h-massachusetts-has-advanced-its-data-privacy-bill">Massachusetts has advanced its data privacy bill.</h3>



<p></p>



<p>For the first time, the commonwealth has moved the Massachusetts Information Privacy Act beyond the committee stage.</p>



<p>As with all other states who have either passed data privacy legislation or have a proposed bill on the table, <strong>Massachusetts wants its citizens to have greater control</strong> <strong>over their personal information in the digital economy</strong>.</p>



<p>In progressing its bill, Massachusetts moves closer to California, Virginia, and Colorado, which have all passed state privacy legislation, although California’s updated law (<a href="https://www.caprivacy.org/cpra-text/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CPRA</a>), and the laws in&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?212+ful+CHAP0035" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2021a_190_signed.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Colorado</a>, don’t take effect until 2023.&nbsp;<strong>All these laws restrict how businesses can collect and use the personal information of residents within the relevant state.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>State-level pushes for comprehensive privacy bills have never looked stronger, with Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska also&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2022/01/4-major-data-privacy-trends-to-watch-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">likely</a>&nbsp;to pass laws in 2022.</p>



<p>Of course, the states continue to act in the absence of a&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/us-federal-privacy-legislation-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">federal privacy law</a>, which appears to remain a long way off, locked in partisan divisions over the detail.</p>



<p>But the goal remains a single federal privacy law with streamlined compliance obligations for business and clear rights for consumers. Recent discussions have looked at what might be the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">minimum protections</a>&nbsp;of a national law, and survey results show&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/11/75-of-americans-want-national-data-privacy-standards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75%</a>&nbsp;of all Americans want some data privacy standards at the national level.</p>

<p>Have you heard the&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/02/facebook-isnt-growing-anymore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news</a>? Facebook has stopped growing.</p>



<p>In a first for the social media giant, its daily active user numbers dropped in the&nbsp;<a href="https://investor.fb.com/investor-events/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last quarter of 2021</a>, and its monthly active user numbers remained steady in the second half of the year. The poor performance sent Meta Platforms stocks plummeting&nbsp;<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27%</a>&nbsp;on Wall Street earlier this month, a result “<a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unprecedented in stock market history</a>”.</p>



<h3 id="h-observers-say-this-distinct-lack-of-growth-for-facebook-comes-from-a-convergence-of-substantial-threats"><a href="https://www.afr.com/markets/equity-markets/meta-faces-historic-stock-rout-after-facebook-growth-stalled-20220204-p59tpc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Observers</a>&nbsp;say this distinct lack of growth for Facebook comes from a convergence of substantial threats:</h3>



<p></p>



<ul><li>Facebook is an aging monolith that no amount of rebranding as part of the new shiny ‘Meta’ stable can hide or reverse. It’s arguably attracted all the new users it’s going to attract.</li><li><a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/07/we-told-you-so-apples-new-privacy-changes-validate-what-weve-done-for-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple iOS privacy changes</a>&nbsp;have hit Facebook’s ad revenue hard, at the same time as advertisers are tightening their belts.</li><li>The platform admits it’s facing stiff competition for user time and attention from TikTok and YouTube, and its own answer to TikTok, Reels, isn’t engaging users as quickly as hoped.</li></ul>



<p><strong>We would add another substantial threat to this list: the privacy tide is turning. We’ve been saying for a long time that&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumers are fed up</a>&nbsp;with&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/do-consumers-even-want-personalized-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trading their privacy for access</a>&nbsp;to products and services.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Consumers have never been louder in their calls for better protection of their personal data by the brands and products they engage with, and it seems Facebook just isn’t hearing them or responding seriously enough. And we all know Facebook isn’t the only one.</p>

<h4>Protecting customer data will continue to be an urgent issue for businesses worldwide in 2022. The risks and requirements are not going away.</h4>



<p></p>



<p>In 2021 we saw users demanding and gaining more control over their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a>. Big tech/ad tech took <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more hits</a> to their data-driven business models, even while introducing variously effective “privacy” measures (such as Google phasing out <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/04/google-pushes-privacy-but-can-a-leopard-really-change-its-spots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">third party cookies</a> and scrapping app developers access to <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/06/google-makes-genuine-privacy-move-by-scrapping-ad-ids-for-users-who-opt-out-of-targeted-ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ad IDs</a> and Apple introducing the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/apples-new-att-and-why-facebook-is-hitting-back-hard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ATT</a> feature and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/12/apple-forces-data-privacy-further-into-the-spotlight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy labels</a> in the App Store). When <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/the-whatsapp-facebook-signal-issue-explained-and-why-mysudo-is-the-best-solution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WhatsApp</a> caused global outrage by demanding its 2 billion-plus users consent to sharing their personal data with Facebook, and Elon Musk switched millions of those users to private messaging app Signal with a two-word tweet, the world was never surer that consumers are tired of trading their personal information for access to services. This sentiment is only intensifying.</p>



<p>Throughout 2021, the regulatory landscape expanded, placing even greater compliance burdens on business and making cross-border data transfers more difficult. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/businesses-face-rising-cybersecurity-risks-from-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">COVID-19</a> and the mass move to remote working environments continued to demand businesses find ways to protect employee devices and secure corporate data and resources as cybersecurity threats ramped up. Contact tracing also amplified the risks of sharing and storing personal information. <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/cisco-the-age-of-privacy-has-arrived-helped-by-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cisco</a> confirmed the pandemic had seriously elevated the importance of data privacy as a business priority and, as we enter the third year of the pandemic, this imperative hasn’t changed. Privacy budgets and resourcing skyrocketed among businesses in response, and governments and health authorities are still struggling to balance public health with protecting personal privacy.</p>



<h3>Obviously, data privacy will remain firmly on the agenda in 2022, so the big trends to watch for are:</h3>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<h4><strong>Privacy regulations and compliance obligations will continue to expand and tighten in the US and globally. </strong></h4>



<p></p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">International Association of Privacy Professionals</a> (IAPP) quotes Goodwin Partner and IAPP Senior Fellow, Omer Tene as saying, “In 2022, expect an avalanche of new laws and regulations, attempting to govern and impose order on a dizzying array of tech developments. New regulatory efforts will range from data protection laws in India and China to AI regulation in the EU to automated decision making rules in US states. Add to that a flurry of enforcement activities, and you get a perfect storm of tech regulation.”<br><br>But <a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tene</a> says it’s unlikely the US will gets its long awaited national privacy law in 2022, but at least six states will move to pass their own (Maryland, Oklahoma, Ohio, New Jersey, Florida and Alaska), and it will be interesting to see whether any of those states includes a <a href="https://lawrina.com/blog/private-right-of-action/#:~:text=According%20to%20Federal%20law%2C%20a,legal%20violations%20under%20a%20statute." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private right of action</a> (PRA) —because, if they don’t, the game could change. “A couple of years ago, conventional wisdom was that the more states pass privacy laws, the greater the pressure will build on the business community, and consequently Congress, to pass preemptive federal legislation. Absent a PRA, however, an interesting dynamic may develop, where the more state privacy laws, the less appetite businesses – who are growing accustomed to complying with the emerging (PRA-less) state framework – have for federal pre-emption,” Tene says.</p>



<p>More tech legislation will flow out of Europe too. In fact, <a href="https://www.goodwinprivacyblog.com/2022/01/03/the-year-ahead-privacy-developments-in-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tene</a> calls it “a veritable alphabet soup of tech regulation affecting digital platforms, digital services, online marketing, data intermediaries and more …”. The <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52021PC0206" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Act</a>, affecting algorithmic decision making across the economy, and the <a href="https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/theme-a-europe-fit-for-the-digital-age/file-data-act" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Act</a>, which broadens legal obligations, including cross-border transfer restrictions, to non-personal data will also be things to watch.</p>



<h4><strong>We’ll see more regulatory enforcement</strong>. </h4>



<p></p>



<p>Governments in the US and Europe are expected to ramp up regulatory enforcement around breach reporting and risk reporting. GDPR enforcement increased in 2021 and this is set to continue. Tene says, “Importantly, regulators are expanding the lens from an early focus on data breaches to challenging companies’ legal bases for processing data and, notably, cross-border data flows. In 2022, expect an additional step up the enforcement ladder. We expect regulators to focus on issues such as protecting children’s data, restricting the use of sensitive health and financial information, and curbing the excess of digital marketing.” Of course, if greater enforcement is to happen, the regulators will need to be adequately resourced. Enforcement times are not getting any shorter on the complex cases. It will also be long overdue. For example, the Schrems II decision was in the middle of 2020 and there has been very minimal (if any?) enforcement action resulting from that change. </p>



<h4><strong>More limits on big tech/ad tech</strong>. </h4>



<p></p>



<p>Regulators, the media and the general public have big tech/ad tech firmly in their sights and will continue to demand more privacy-first data tracking and sharing practices and business models. As we <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/consumers-could-gain-from-ftcs-stronger-focus-on-data-protection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> last year, the Federal Trade Commission could go harder on consumer privacy protection and cybersecurity with President Biden’s recent nomination of digital “privacy hawk” and law professor <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/09/14/alvaro-bedoya-ftc-biden/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alvaro Bedoya</a> and House Democrats’ <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2021/09/09/democrats-tech-reconciliation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposal</a> to allocate $1 billion for a new privacy and data security bureau. </p>



<p>Tene notes: “Under the leadership of new Chair Lina Khan, the FTC has issued strong <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/jsp/eAgenda/StaticContent/202110/Statement_3084_FTC.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statements and strategic plans</a> for broad <a href="https://www.reginfo.gov/public/do/eAgendaViewRule?pubId=202110&amp;RIN=3084-AB69" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rulemaking</a> efforts, including rules to curb “abuses stemming from surveillance-based business models” and “lax security practices” and to “ensure that algorithmic decision-making does not result in unlawful discrimination.” But he notes this in part depends on Bedoya’s appointment proceeding in the Senate, which may not be quick. </p>



<h4><strong>Consumers will continue to favor brands that are genuinely good, honest stewards of their personal data.</strong> </h4>



<p></p>



<p><a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cisco</a> released research findings in October 2021 which it says, ”demonstrates the growing importance of privacy to the individual and its implications on the businesses and governments that serve them.” <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eighty-six per cent</a> of respondents said they care about data privacy and want more control, and <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/consumer-privacy-study-finds-online-privacy-is-of-growing-concern-to-increasingly-more-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">79 percent</a> said they’d be willing to vote with their wallet and not support businesses that don’t protect their data and would indeed pay for better data protection. This sounds like the new growing market of “<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/why-no-brand-can-afford-to-ignore-the-new-privacy-actives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy actives</a>” we discussed last year and which no brand can afford to ignore. Cisco reminds business that data abuses have eroded trust in brands, which is one reason it has released its <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/about/doing_business/trust-center/docs/cisco-new-trust-standard.pdf?CCID=cc000742&amp;DTID=esootr000875&amp;OID=wprsc027437" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New Trust Standard</a>, which we’ll explore in a separate article soon.</p>



<p>Clearly the opportunity for businesses to build customer trust and loyalty by responding authentically to what their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">customers want and need</a> are enormous. As <a href="https://www.pwc.com/us/en/tech-effect/cybersecurity/trusted-tech.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PwC</a> says, brands that get customer privacy and safety right will disrupt the market. Our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo Platform</a> privacy and cybersafety services platform can help you to rapidly develop and deploy branded customer solutions.</p>

<p>Here at <a href="https://anonyome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anonyome Labs</a>, we’re gearing up to celebrate <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/data-privacy-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Data Privacy Week 2022</a> from January 24 to 28.</p>



<p>The week-long event is an international effort to empower individuals and encourage businesses to respect privacy, safeguard <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data</a> and enable trust. And that goal aligns nicely with what we do here at <a href="https://anonyome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anonyome Labs</a>.</p>



<p>Data Privacy Week is an annual opportunity to amplify the conversation about the real risks to our <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data privacy</a> that exist in the highly connected digital world, and to encourage people to take action. For businesses, that could mean working with us to rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersafety solutions using our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo Platform</a> complete business toolkit. Read more about how our solutions <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/dr-paul-ashley-presents-on-how-to-solve-the-privacy-problem/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">help solve the data privacy problem</a>.</p>



<p>We’re actively participating in this year’s Data Privacy Week, with our co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley presenting during <a href="https://www.riseofprivacytech.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Rise of Privacy Tech (TROPT)</a> event on January 26 and 27 2022.</p>



<p>Dr Ashley will discuss “Progress and Pitfalls on the Path to Decentralization”, and we’ll bring you details of how you can catch this presentation closer to the time.</p>



<p>As a business in today’s highly connected digital world, there’s never been a better time to think hard about how you collect, store and share your customers’ <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a>. Certainly, <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consumers worldwide</a> are calling for better stewardship of their personal information by business and government, especially as the United States lags well behind most of the rest of the world in developing a national data privacy regulation. Latest figures show <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% of Americans</a> want national data privacy standards and there’s useful discussion of what customer data <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/10/the-us-data-privacy-law-floor-what-deserves-basic-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deserves basic privacy protections</a>. But while the US government clearly recognizes the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national security risks</a> of <a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/07/the-rise-of-surveillance-capitalism-or-whatever-happened-to-my-internet-free-will/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surveillance capitalism</a>, it is yet to settle on a regulatory solution. We hope 2022 brings more progress.</p>



<p>So in the meantime, we encourage businesses to be proactive about how they protect their customers’ information. Joining in some of the Data Privacy Week 2022 activities and the wider <a href="https://staysafeonline.org/cybersecurity-awareness-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cybersecurity Awareness Month</a> activities, which the National Cybersecurity Alliance and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security launched in October 2004, is a great place to start—as is talking to us about <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo Platform</a> would help your business.</p>

<p>It’s been a big year for reining in big tech, with all&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/12/16/big-tech-critics-mustered-their-forces-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sorts of developments</a>&nbsp;and no doubt more to come in 2022.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One recent&nbsp;<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2021/11/26/agcm-fines-apple-google/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story</a>&nbsp;is that Google and Apple were each fined&nbsp;€10 million by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agcm.it/media/comunicati-stampa/2021/11/PS11147-PS11150" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Italy’s competition and market authority</a>&nbsp;(AGCM) for not providing their customers with clear information about how they use their data commercially, and for being “aggressive” in pushing users to accept commercial processing of data. These actions violate Italy’s consumer code.</p>



<p>According to the AGCM, Google didn’t give users relevant information at the account creation stage and when using services so they could make informed decisions about whether or not to consent to their data being used for commercial purposes.</p>



<p>Apple copped the fine for reportedly failing to give users immediate access to clear information about how it uses customer information commercially when a customer creates an Apple ID or accesses digital stores like the App Store.</p>



<p>This news is interesting because let’s face it: we expected it from Google, but Apple is one of the good guys on privacy—or so its careful marketing narrative would lead us all to believe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To us, these sanctions are yet another reason why every consumer needs&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudos</a>—secure, customizable digital identities or ‘profiles’ that intentionally differentiate from a consumer’s personal identity and protect their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a>.&nbsp;Regulators and watch dogs usually don’t intervene in data misuse until after harm has been done. So isn’t it better to close the gate&nbsp;<em>before</em>&nbsp;the horse bolts?&nbsp;</p>
