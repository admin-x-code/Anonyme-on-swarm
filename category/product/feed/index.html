<p>Anonyome Labs already maintains validator nodes in support of the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/our-recent-upgrade-to-our-sovrin-network-validator-node-in-australia-supports-the-decentralized-identity-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sovrin</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/05/anonyome-labs-joins-the-indicio-mainnet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indicio</a>&nbsp;networks. Recently we increased our contribution to decentralized identity and verifiable credentials by becoming a founding member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cheqd.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheqd</a>&nbsp;production network. With more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bosch.com/stories/self-sovereign-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies leveraging SSI</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.egovernment.ch/en/umsetzung/schwerpunktplan/elektronische-identitat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">governments beginning to implement them</a>, large-scale public adoption of these technologies appears to be around the corner.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs is particularly interested in new economic models for SSI technologies and infrastructures that can amplify adoption by end-users, businesses, and governments. Economic incentives provide a way for validators to be rewarded for running the network and for issuers of verifiable credentials to be rewarded for issuing credentials. The adoption of these new economic models in turn increases the amount of SSI credentials in circulation, making it increasingly easier, more efficient, and more secure for organizations to get trusted data from the consenting identity subject. These financial incentives are a clear driver for transition from centralized and federated identity systems to an SSI ecosystem.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-are-verifiable-credentials"><strong>What are verifiable credentials?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>In short, they are tamper-proof credentials that can be verified cryptographically. Their use cases include checking the validity of travel visas, healthcare certificates, airline tickets, credit score checks and credentials for opening a bank account. Three parties take place in the verifiable credential workflow: the&nbsp;<strong>issuer</strong>&nbsp;digitally signs a document and sends it to the&nbsp;<strong>holder</strong>&nbsp;which can then present their credential (to W3C specifications) to a&nbsp;<strong>verifier</strong>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>A verifier checks presented credentials and verifies the contained authority, validity, and tamper-proof characteristics of the credential. If validity conditions are met and the presented credential contains the required claims, the holder is granted access to an associated resource or service.</p>



<h3 id="h-why-do-we-need-tokens-for-ssi"><strong>Why do we need tokens for SSI?</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Currently the main method of paying for verifiable credentials is through conventional payment networks. This has several drawbacks as mentioned in Sovrin’s&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/wp-content/uploads/Sovrin-Protocol-and-Token-White-Paper.pdf#Sovrin-Whitepaper-v5b.indd%3ABut%20today%2C%20the%20only%20option%20for%20paying%20for%20verifiable%20credentials%20is%20conventional%20payment%20networks%3A132" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whitepaper</a>, where:</p>



<ul><li>markets are restricted to only the highest value credentials</li><li>current issuers are at risk of data breaches</li><li>credentials are not privacy respecting.&nbsp;<br></li></ul>



<p>Since third-party identification issuers (such as credit bureaus) charge a fee to verify a user’s identity, it can be assumed that paying for credentials will remain a fundamental element of SSI. Tokens act as a solution to this problem, with&nbsp;<a href="https://sovrin.org/sovrin-foundation-launches-test-token-for-decentralized-identity-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sovrin having already designed and tested tokens for their network (but not put them into production).</a></p>



<h3 id="h-what-is-cheqd"><a href="https://www.cheqd.io/ssi-self-sovereign-identity-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>What is cheqd?</strong></a></h3>



<p></p>



<p>cheqd’s network is bult on the Cosmos blockchain with a dedicated token for payment which enables new business models for verifiers, holders and issuers. In these business models, verifiable credentials are exchanged in a trusted, reusable, safer, and cheaper way — alongside a customizable fee.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-how-cheqd-uses-tokenomics"><strong>How cheqd uses tokenomics&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>cheqd employs concepts of tokenomics on top of governance which sets it apart from the Sovrin network. With any of the three participants – holders, validators, and issuers – capable of receiving tokens as an incentive, it promotes participation and accountability, which will facilitate a greater adoption of the technology and SSI as a whole. This allows users to reclaim their privacy, and organizations to build their reputation and reduce the potential for fraudulent credentials. The value of $CHEQ depends on&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.cheqd.io/cheqds-tokenomics-for-ssi-explained-part-2-c4ecfc32b813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several factors</a>&nbsp;including overall cryptocurrency market health, cheqd protocol resilience and the real-world implementation of use cases by SSI vendors.</p>



<h3 id="h-cheqd-s-choice-of-sdk"><strong>cheqd’s choice of SDK</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>In&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.sovrin.org/hyperledger-welcomes-project-indy-77e8b2c62dcf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2017 Sovrin open sourced their codebase to Hyperledger Indy</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;<a href="https://indicio.tech/indy_network_transaction_wizard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indicio builds upon to provide its services and network</a>. Hyperledger Indy is a collection of tools, libraries and further components for digital identities rooted on blockchains. It’s important to note that tokens are not natively supported; in fact Brian Behlendorf, Executive Director of the Hyperledger Project, mentioned in an interview that “<a href="https://www.eweek.com/cloud/hyperledger-blockchain-project-is-not-about-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’ll never see a Hyperledger coin</a>” and “by not pushing a currency, we avoid so many political challenges of having to maintain a globally consistent currency.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>cheqd’s network is built on the&nbsp;<a href="https://tendermint.com/sdk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cosmos SDK</a>&nbsp;which has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/advanced-concepts/building-on-cosmos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several benefits</a>. They include Cosmos’s identity capabilities, easily customizable token behavior, on-ledger voting for governance frameworks and smart contract functionality. cheqd’s&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cosmos.network/master/intro/why-app-specific.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">application-specific blockchain</a>&nbsp;implementation addresses the shortcomings of smart contracts by building a full-node client, a light-client, and all the necessary interfaces (CLI, REST, etc.) to interact with the nodes. These reasons make Cosmos a viable solution as an SDK since the added benefits that tokenomics bring allows cheqd to develop a network for SSI applications.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-cheqd-did-method"><strong>cheqd DID method</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Decentralized identifiers (DIDs) are cryptographically proven, verifiable and decentralized digital identities. DIDs are designed to be decoupled from centralized registries, identity providers and certificate authorities. A DID can refer to any subject, entity, organization, thing, data model or abstract entity as specified by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/#dfn-did-controllers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DID controller</a>. Where DIDs come into play is their ability to be stored on the blockchain as a public verifiable data registry. These immutable records can be queried for the authenticity/validity of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.evernym.com/blog/gentle-introduction-verifiable-credentials/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">verifiable credential</a>&nbsp;to see who issued without consulting the issuer.<br></p>



<p>cheqd has&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/architecture/adr-list/adr-002-cheqd-did-method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">proposed</a>&nbsp;that it will build on Hyperledger Indy DID method, renaming&nbsp;<a href="https://hyperledger-indy.readthedocs.io/projects/node/en/latest/transactions.html#nym">NYM</a>&nbsp;transactions to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DID</a> transactions and removing&nbsp;<em>roles</em>&nbsp;to move from a&nbsp;<strong>public-permissioned&nbsp;</strong>network to&nbsp;<strong>public-permissionless</strong>.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-anonyome-validator-configuration"><strong>The Anonyome validator configuration</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Because of the potential advantages of having a token as part of the decentralized identity network, Anonyome Labs has configured and brought online its own&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">validator</a>. We use Amazon Web Services to deploy our validator, however the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/node/docs/setup-and-configure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cheqd-noded software can be run by other hosting providers or even locally</a>.</p>



<p>To successfully become part of the cheqd production network and have an operational validator, we:</p>



<ul><li>set up an AWS elastic cloud (EC2) instance running Ubuntu 20.04</li><li>configured a virtual private cloud (VPC) using security groups at the network interface level to act as a firewall</li><li>enabled automatic backups via AMI policies</li><li>created custom SNS topic to Slack notifications for outlier detection within CloudWatch Metrics.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-aws-elastic-cloud-ec2"><strong><em>AWS elastic cloud (EC2)</em></strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>To run the cheqd validator installation we currently use a t3.small EC2 with the Ubuntu server 20.04 LTS (HVM) image. The storage is split across two EBS volumes: a 10GB EBS volume for the operating system and cheqd software and another 150GB EBS for the cheqd home directory containing the increasingly large data directory which stores the ledger.</p>



<p>Both disks are encrypted, and the 150 GB volume is mounted within the operating system and set as the home directory for the cheqd user account.</p>



<h3 id="h-virtual-private-cloud-vpc"><strong><em>Virtual private cloud (VPC)</em></strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>The VPC security groups are configured to whitelist inbound and outbound traffic, only allowing specific access to SSH, RPC and HTTP/HTTPS ports from pre-determined IP addresses. Deliberately specifying which traffic the validator allows/expects reduces the potential for vulnerabilities that can be exploited. An elastic-IP connects to the EC2 instance which grants the validator a static IP.</p>



<h3 id="h-ami-backup-policies"><strong><em>AMI backup policies</em></strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>To ensure swift recovery from any outages, attacks or node misconfigurations, an EBS-backed AMI policy has been put in place to make daily and monthly backups. These backups create live snapshots of the system such that when the validator must be restored, it resumes from the snapshot’s instance state. This aims to minimize downtime on the network and the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.cheqd.io/governance/tokenomics/slashing-explained">slashing penalties</a>&nbsp;that incur. When restoring from an AMI, the validator only needs to catch up from its latest block height and match that of the networks rather than a new validator which would have to catch up from the beginning, potentially saving days of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-sns-topic-to-slack-notifications"><strong><em>SNS topic to Slack notifications</em></strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>Enabling telemetry via Slack notifications allows for real-time error handling and informative reporting on the status and health of our validator. This minimizes the risk to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the node through notifying problem-specific alerts which can be acted on immediately.</p>



<p>Some of the triggers our system looks out for are:</p>



<ul><li>abnormally high resource usage (CPU, RAM, NetIO)</li><li>unusual cheqd network statistics (no validators on the network)</li><li>security alerts (unauthorized access)</li><li>general instance status metrics.</li></ul>



<h3 id="h-future-plans"><strong>Future plans</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>With new technologies come new challenges and by nature many learnings and improvements are discovered. While we have our&nbsp;<a href="https://explorer.cheqd.io/validator/cheqdvaloper1djh8syeug9ylw7v8ca6jvq3s59klzmm4fm949w">node</a>&nbsp;actively validating, there are several improvements that we are making to our system architecture to tighten security and reduce the risk of downtime.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Upgrading the network to a multi-node&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#setting-up-a-validator">sentry-validator architecture&nbsp;</a>allows for stronger protection from DOS attacks and other threats which can be mitigated by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/honey-pot">honeypots</a>. Although more complex than a single validator instance, the benefit of reduced downtime in the case of an attack ensures a lower risk of slashing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In order to reduce the risk of lost or stolen tokens earned through validating, we aim to use a cold-wallet backup solution. The implementation will include further steps to tighten security, such as multi-factor authentication, hardware cold-wallets and internal auditing, which in turn minimizes the attack vector.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Other future considerations may include securing validator keys using a&nbsp;<a href="https://cpl.thalesgroup.com/encryption/hardware-security-modules">HSM</a>&nbsp;or other implementations which secure the&nbsp;<a href="https://ed25519.cr.yp.to/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ed25519</a>&nbsp;keys used by&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.tendermint.com/master/nodes/validators.html#validator-keys">Tendermint Core</a>. These improvements and alterations to the validator are first performed on our Testnet node before they are applied to the Mainnet. Since Testnet tokens have no actual value, they can be used to develop, test, and deploy security changes without having the risks associated with making changes on the Mainnet validator.</p>

<p>To give you some insight into the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">innovation and expertise</a>&nbsp;we bring to persona-based products, here are 17 of the patents filed during the creation of MySudo and Sudo Platform.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona System</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Masking a Real User Controlling Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9372987, June 20, 2016 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This patent outlines the design of a persona application and persona services that allow a user to create personas for their own use and where only they know the identity and can operate the personas that they own. The persona services do not have the information to relate users to personas.</p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Administering Proxy Identities, Patent #: US10356052, July 16, 2019 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This patent outlines the design for the persona services. Each user can have multiple personas, each persona fitted with identity attributes such as phone number, email address, virtual payments information, contacts, and avatar, and with capabilities such as communications, browsing, anonymous payments, and reputation. The persona services also allow for a marketplace of personas so that personas can be bought and sold between users.</p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Building, Extending and Managing Interactions Between Digital Identities and Digital Identity Applications, Patent #: US10931650, February 23, 2021 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This is a more detailed examination of the design of the persona applications and persona services, including verifying the distribution of applications built from the persona services.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona Anonymity with Recourse</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Enabling Owner Authorized Monitored Stewardship Over Protected Data in Computing Devices, Patent #: US10963582, March 30, 2021 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This is a design for an anonymity with recourse system that allows a user to maintain complete anonymity, possession of cryptographic keys, possession of encrypted communication and so on up to the point where a legal process allows uncovering of that data. The blockchain-based system records the implementation of the process steps so that any collusion or misbehavior by participants can be uncovered.</p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Managing Digital Identities and Controlling Their Correlation to Legal Identities, Patent #: US11159578, October 26, 2021 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This builds on the generic anonymity with recourse system in the above patent to focus on the use of personas for anonymity and how under legal due process the identity of the user can be uncovered. Again, a blockchain-based system ensures that any misbehavior is uncovered.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona Usage with Decentralized Identities</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Digital Wallet for Digital Identities and Interactions with a Digital Identity Services Platform, US16/821,181, March 17, 2020 (Filed)</em></p>

Each persona has a decentralized identity wallet holding encryption keys, DIDs, verifiable credentials and other information specifically for that persona.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Persona Reputation</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>A Decentralized Reputation Service for Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9703986, July 11, 2017 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This defines a system and method to calculate ongoing persona reputation. It also uses a block chain as an immutable store of the reputation calculation.</p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Establishing Trust of Anonymous Identities, Patent #: US11177937, November 16, 2021 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This disclosure is an extension to the reputation design outlined above. This disclosure presents a method whereby a reputation score can be calculated for anonymous online users (personas) by analyzing their public activities performed in online settings, analytics gathering, and/or other disclosed or discoverable data points. Inputs to the reputation score may come from the ratings or reviews submitted by other parties of verified transactions where an online user has participated, such as purchases, rentals, enrolments etc.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Persona-Based Anonymous Payments</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Processing Virtual Credit Cards for Digital Identities, US 16/985,962, August 14, 2020 (Filed)</em></p>



<p>This patent outlines a design for allowing anonymous payments by providing personas each with virtual payment cards. The system outlines how these cards are created, managed and closed.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona-Based Browsing</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>A Persona-Based Privacy Browser, US16/877,976, May 19, 2020 (Filed)</em></p>



<p>This describes the design of a persona-based browser application system that allows for improved anonymization and compartmentalization of persona browsing by allowing the creation of an individual browser configuration/instance for each persona.</p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Persona Based Isolation Browsing, August 15, 2019 (Filed)</em></p>



<p>This patent extends the persona-based privacy browser application design above by allowing the creation of an individual isolation browser configuration/instance for each persona.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona-Based Email</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Email Application for Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9729519, August 8, 2017 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This outlines the design for an email system for users with multiple personas. This provides compartmentalized email for each persona. The email communication is encrypted between personas.</p>



<p><em>Method and System for Automating Secure Email for Multiple Personas, Patent #: US10382211, August 13, 2019 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This patent extends the above patent to describe the design of a standards-based S/MIME persona-based email system to allow encrypted persona-to-persona email, or encrypted persona-to-third party S/MIME email.</p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Managing Digital Identities, Patent #: US10511493, December 17, 2019 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This extends the above patents to specifically describe the management of multiple email accounts for each persona. These are machine-generated random email accounts such that a single persona could have an account for each service that the persona interacts with, giving the user very fine-grained control of email accounts for each persona.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona-Based VPN</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Method and System for Providing Persona Masking in a Computer Network, Patent #: US10320753, June 11, 2019 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This describes the design of a persona-based VPN system that allows for improved anonymization and compartmentalization of persona traffic by allowing the creation of a VPN configuration for each persona.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona-Based Telephony</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Supporting Telephonic Synthetic Identities, Patent #: US9374689, June 20, 2016 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This outlines the design for a telephony application system for users with multiple personas. The telephony communication provides both SMS/MMS and voice calling, with each persona having one or more telephony numbers. This provides compartmentalized telephony for each persona.</p>



<h3><strong>Persona Protection</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p><em>Apparatus and Method for Identifying and Warning of Synthetic Identity Behavior that Reduces User Privacy, Patent #: US10178106, January 8, 2019 (Issued)</em></p>



<p>This patent defines methods for protection from unwittingly disclosing the relationship between a persona identity and user identity, or between persona identities. The aim is to keep strong compartmentalization and to not reduce user privacy.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce Anonyome Labs is listed in the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP)&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Privacy Tech Vendor Report 2021</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs joins&nbsp;355&nbsp;other&nbsp;qualified organizations in&nbsp;the&nbsp;2021&nbsp;compendium of&nbsp;privacy tech vendors. This is a significant increase from the 44 vendors listed in the inaugural report in 2017.&nbsp;The number of&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories&nbsp;is also higher in 2021: now 11 categories split across two groups&nbsp;—&nbsp;Privacy program management and&nbsp;Enterprise privacy management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We see this growth in both vendor numbers and&nbsp;priv&nbsp;tech categories as evidence of the explosion in market awareness of&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;of&nbsp;the vital need to protect&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personally identifiable information</a>&nbsp;among consumers and enterprise.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The IAPP agrees, saying these changes represent as a “metamorphosis” in the privacy landscape in recent years.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When the IAPP released its 2017 report, it described the privacy technology marketplace as being “on the precipice of a major evolutionary shift”. You’ll recall the EU’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR</a>&nbsp;was about a year off becoming law and the marketplace had some early tech vendors.&nbsp;(<a href="https://anonyome.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anonyome Labs</a>&nbsp;was around at this time—we were established in&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2014</a>&nbsp;through the pioneering foresight of our early founders—but&nbsp;we&nbsp;were still developing our early products.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since 2017,&nbsp;the world has&nbsp;seen the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/11/california-prop-24-puts-more-brakes-on-big-tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Consumer Privacy Act&nbsp;2018</a>, Brazil’s&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr.eu/gdpr-vs-lgpd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">General Data Protection Law2018</a>, and other privacy laws around the world, including plenty of&nbsp;regulatory&nbsp;movement at the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">state level in the US</a>.&nbsp;This raft of&nbsp;new&nbsp;compliance requirements has brought&nbsp;a corresponding increase in the demand for privacy tech.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As an aside, the rise of privacy&nbsp;tech was the focus of an expert panel at this year’s Data Privacy Day. Read&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/8-key-takeaways-from-the-rise-of-privacy-tech-panel-with-our-co-ceo-dr-paul-ashley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8 Key Takeaways From the ‘Rise of Privacy Tech’ Panel With Our Co-CEO Dr Paul Ashley</a>&nbsp;for some considered insights.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In releasing the&nbsp;5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;edition of the&nbsp;Privacy Tech Vendor Report&nbsp;in&nbsp;2021,&nbsp;the IAPP&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/resources/article/privacy-tech-vendor-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes</a>: “Privacy tech has undergone a paradigm shift over the past five years, affecting everything from the development of&nbsp;privacy tech tools to the attitude toward privacy tech vendors. The five-year mark of the report’s existence is perhaps the proper time to look at how far the privacy tech market has gone and where it will go in the future”.&nbsp;(We’ve been thinking about the future of privacy for a while. Read our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year forecast</a>.)&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the 2021 report, Anonyome Labs is listed under the Privacy Information Managers category&nbsp;as the best fit, but we acknowledge that our enterprise offering,&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a>, is difficult to categorize given its unique depth and breadth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudo&nbsp;Platform&nbsp;is&nbsp;a scalable developer platform that provides companies with the necessary tools to build privacy and&nbsp;cybersafety&nbsp;solutions into new and existing products for their end users. The&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform’s public APIs and SDKs offer developers various privacy-oriented capabilities including private telephony and email services, end-to-end encrypted communications, private browsing, password management, virtual card payments. These capabilities are available for mobile, desktop, and web applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>Inside&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform</strong>&nbsp;</h3>



<p></p>



<p>At the heart of&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform is our&nbsp;innovative digital identity concept called the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/%22%20/t%20%22_blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo</a>. A Sudo is a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a>.   &nbsp;</p>



<p>A&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a real, alternative identity that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;profile and manage it.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>Sudos are the&nbsp;centerpiece&nbsp;of our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo&nbsp;Platform</a> complete business toolkit for rapidly producing branded cybersecurity solutions, and our exemplar consumer privacy app, <a href="https://mysudo.com/%22%20/t%20%22_blank" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySudo</a>. &nbsp;</p>



<p>When enterprises access&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;Platform to rapidly produce branded cybersecurity solutions, they can use the&nbsp;Sudo&nbsp;as part of a <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">menu of high value privacy tools</a> delivered as easy-to-use APIs and SDKs.  &nbsp;</p>



<p>When giving the recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.engineersaustralia.org.au/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Engineers Australia</a> Annual Informatics Lecture, our co-CEO and CTO, <a href="https://anonyome.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr Paul Ashley</a>, spoke on <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a> and the tech driving it this <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decade</a>, particularly identity and anonymous profiles online. Paul shared that in developing the&nbsp;Sudo, we wanted to do something that hasn’t been done before. And that’s what the global fight for privacy will demand from us and others in this space, as well as any company that engages with user data: out of the box thinking and <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/how-we-apply-the-7-principles-of-privacy-by-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy by design</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A core capability of Anonyome Labs’ products is the&nbsp;<strong>Sudo</strong>—a secure, customizable digital identity or ‘profile’ that intentionally differentiates from a consumer’s personal identity and protects their&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal data</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A Sudo isn’t a ‘burner’ or fake ID—it’s a&nbsp;<em>real</em>,&nbsp;<em>alternative</em>&nbsp;identity that a consumer can use anywhere their personal identity is required. The consumer’s Sudo profile is a secure stand-in for their personal identity, and it’s entirely under their control. They create the Sudo profile and manage it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>How a consumer accesses and uses Sudo profiles entirely depends on how a business leverages <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo Platform</a> to meet its product offering objectives. Sudo Platform is the complete privacy toolkit for integrating next generation identity protection and privacy into a brand’s products and services. Sudo Platform is so flexible, it offers endless product applications. Sudo profile functionality is possible in any Sudo Platform-powered product. </p>



<h4><strong>A user can have one Sudo or many</strong></h4>



<p>Products built using Sudo Platform can enable single or multiple Sudo personas. A single Sudo application might be easy to imagine, but a multiple Sudo application is a sophisticated approach that opens greater possibilities for customer identity protection. The enormous benefit of multiple Sudo applications is they enable&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalization-is-the-most-powerful-data-privacy-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compartmentalization</a>&nbsp;which&nbsp;adds an extra dimension to how consumers can protect their personal data.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our popular consumer app,&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySudo</a>, is an example of an application that allows multiple Sudos, each with private phone, messaging, email, browser and virtual credit cards enabled. A user can create up to nine different Sudo profiles and use them for different purposes and activities online and in-person (e.g. online shopping, and booking local services like hairdressers and plumbers). MySudo is the world’s only all-in-one privacy app and one of its greatest selling points is that it&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/04/why-compartmentalizing-your-private-data-is-simple-with-mysudo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">makes compartmentalization simple</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But, MySudo is only one example application of Sudo Platform, and there are countless possibilities for Sudo based products.</p>



<h4><strong>Sudo personas have many benefits</strong></h4>



<ul><li>Sudos powerfully&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/sudo-digital-identities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">protect</a>&nbsp;personal information.</li><li>Sudos are&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/09/encryption-in-mysudo-a-deep-dive-on-how-we-keep-your-data-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entirely private</a>&nbsp;to the user.</li><li>Sudos are&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2020/06/we-all-wear-many-hats-in-life-using-sudo-digital-identities-is-the-same-thing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">purpose-driven</a>, so they can be short-lived or long-lived.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>Short-lived Sudos are usually for transactional activities, such as buying and selling in a marketplace. Once the user has bought the bike or sold the antique dresser, for example, they no longer want or need to interact with the stranger with whom they made the deal. The same applies in the dating world: until the user feels comfortable about their new friend, they might not want that new friend having their personal phone number or email address. A Sudo dating profile is a sensible personal safety measure. Another example is travel ticketing and insurance for a particular trip. Once the consumer returns home from their adventures, they no longer have a need for those details.</p>



<p>Long-lived Sudo applications on the other hand are for cases where both the service provider relationship and the need to maintain records relevant to that relationship endure. Examples are a networking Sudo for all work events and new client contacts, or a banking Sudo for securing and managing personal finance.</p>



<p>Bottom line? Sudos are flexible and a revolutionary data privacy tool.</p>

<p><em>“Data is the pollution problem of the information age, and protecting privacy is the environmental challenge.” – Bruce Schneier</em></p>



<p>Today it is difficult to do just about anything online without a company, or two or more knowing who you are, where you are, and where you have been. We live in a time where digital surveillance has never been more pervasive. Analytics are running constantly and opaquely behind the scenes to learn everything about you for reasons such as predicting your next move, what to sell to you, or how best to sell your data to others.</p>



<p>At Anonyome Labs, we are providing protection for the online community with the&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/">MySudo</a>&nbsp;application and&nbsp;<a href="https://sudoplatform.com/">Sudo Platform</a>. MySudo is an easy to use tool for creating online identities equipped with a customizable name, phone number, email address, private browser and virtual cards. Sudo Platform allows enterprises to embed the privacy technologies showcased in MySudo into their own applications.</p>



<p>As a data scientist, I was trained to want any and all data to throw into a model and become a prediction hero. As a privacy advocate, I acknowledge that analytics cannot be the wild west, and gladly accept the challenge to help inform Anonyome’s business without becoming what we are helping users to protect against. In the rest of this article, I will discuss how analytics for MySudo is operated under a privacy lens.</p>



<p>From the perspective of the privacy conscious consumer, including the Anonyome team who identify as such, “less is best” when it comes to processing personal data. This starts with minimizing data collection. We do not collect your legal identity information or other personal data before you start using our services, with the exception of regulated parts of our offering such as virtual cards. You can read more about this in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006496314-What-information-does-a-user-have-to-provide-when-they-install-and-setup-MySudo-">this FAQ</a>. If we don’t collect your personal data, we can’t use it, misuse it or lose it if we were to experience a data breach (and we work hard to make sure that doesn’t happen). The “less is best” core value aligns well to minimizing dark data, a form of data debt accrued over time. Gartner defines dark data as “Information assets organizations collect, process, and store during regular business activities, but generally fail to use for other purposes”&nbsp;<sup>[1]</sup>. Dark data will remain at a minimum by Anonyome’s choice to intentionally store less information about our consumers.</p>



<p>User content, such as the text of email messages, SMS messages and the like, is never processed beyond what you would expect us to do – deliver the messages to your intended recipients or to you in the most secure way possible. If the communications are from MySudo user to MySudo user, they’re end-to-end encrypted and Anonyome can’t read the messages even if we wanted to (we don’t). For messages sent or received via regular SMS or email, they may be visible to third parties when they pass through networks beyond the control of the Sudo Platform. Read more in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006498074-Are-all-communications-encrypted-between-Sudo-users-">this FAQ article</a>.When we analyze the usage of MySudo across our user base, we’re usually interested in aggregated time series data. For example, how many calls and messages were made last week&nbsp;<em>across all MySudo users</em>, is the relationship between ratio of incoming to outgoing email messages changing over time&nbsp;<em>across all MySudo users</em>? This analysis does not require long term access to the content or metadata of individual user communications, so we don’t preserve that beyond what is required for our users to use MySudo and access their messages and call logs. An example of how this aggregate works in practice is illustrated in the diagram below.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="171" src="https://anonyome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-1024x171.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1978" srcset="https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-1024x171.png 1024w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-300x50.png 300w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-768x129.png 768w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-239x40.png 239w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-570x95.png 570w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05-855x143.png 855w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.05.png 1374w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Some usage requires that uniqueness be preserved, without needing to know the value that makes the data unique. For example, to analyze how users are consuming their subscribed entitlements under a paid MySudo subscription, we need to be able to differentiate between the activity of different MySudo phone numbers, without needing to know what the specific phone numbers are. Tokenization is a form of de-identification and cryptographic hashing is a useful technique for doing so. Hashing provides protection by converting input to an output that appears random but maintains uniqueness. In this way, analytics can be performed on the data without needing to know actual identity values. When implemented well, it is also computationally very difficult to convert back to its original form.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1006" height="484" src="https://anonyome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15.png" alt="" class="wp-image-1979" srcset="https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15.png 1006w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15-300x144.png 300w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15-768x369.png 768w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15-83x40.png 83w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15-570x274.png 570w, https://3mrfkn2zieuc3mxi6d26ag4d-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-31-09.21.15-686x330.png 686w" sizes="(max-width: 1006px) 100vw, 1006px" /></figure>



<p>A second technique is to reduce the precision or accuracy of data. For this, we use techniques such as differential privacy, where we introduce randomly generated noise to the data and rounding of numerical data elements. This reduces the re-identification risk of the data while preserving a reduced but acceptable level of analysis against our business objectives.</p>

<p>Whether the data is aggregated or individual, we define explicit retention periods for the data we hold. You can read more about what we do with MySudo in&nbsp;<a href="https://support.mysudo.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006599413-How-long-do-you-store-information-">this FAQ article</a>. By contrast, we see the choice&nbsp;of others&nbsp;to keep data “indefinitely” as rarely a thoughtful choice and more likely associated with mindsets of “don’t know why we even have this data” and “it’s not important to us to think about consumer privacy until we are forced to”. I believe this thinking is now antiquated.</p>



<p>Lastly, as described in our&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/privacy-policy/">privacy policy</a>, we never sell the limited data we do have to third parties, and we never will.</p>



<p>I’d like to think that Anonyome is a leader in defining a more responsible way to think about, implement and use analytics. I hope this article has given you some ideas on how to adopt a more privacy sensitive approach to analytics in your own organization. Your users will thank you for it!</p>

<p>One of the great things about the privacy and cyber security space is how it brings together a diverse group of people who share similar goals. Recently, I participated in a workshop led by the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="University of Queensland (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.uq.edu.au/" target="_blank">University of Queensland</a>  on&nbsp;<strong>information resilience</strong>, where I had the opportunity to meet interesting academics from UQ’s <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Institute of Social Science Research (opens in a new tab)" href="https://issr.uq.edu.au/" target="_blank">Institute of Social Science Research</a>, namely Professor <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Rhema Vaithianathan (opens in a new tab)" href="https://issr.uq.edu.au/profile/2438/rhema-vaithianathan" target="_blank">Rhema Vaithianathan</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Professor Mark Western (opens in a new tab)" href="https://issr.uq.edu.au/profile/884/mark-western" target="_blank">Professor Mark Western</a>, who share a passion for the same problems that Anonyome was created to solve. Rhema and Mark come at the problem space from the social implications, where I tend to start from the technology. Gladly, we rapidly found common ground.</p>



<h3>The Transparent Data Use Dial</h3>



<p>At the workshop, Rhema and Mark introduced me to the&nbsp;<strong>transparent data use dial</strong>, a tool first used in New Zealand to that captures the important questions that New Zealand citizens most wanted answered about how a government agency or private organization might use their data. These questions are central to how trust is created and cultivated between an individual and an organization that processes their data.</p>

<h3>How does Anonyome Labs and MySudo stack up?</h3>



<p>In this section, I am going to use the transparent data use dial to self-assess how Anonyome Labs engages with users and handles their data when they use the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="MySudo (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mysudo.com" target="_blank">MySudo</a> app and its Sudo Platform back-end services. Publishing this self-assessment is a step towards improved transparency itself, but perhaps equally importantly, a mechanism to identify areas for future improvement. I acknowledge that I may have unconscious bias as I do this, but I will try and provide detail for each of the claims I am making.</p>



<h3>Value</h3>



<h4><strong>Who will be using my data?</strong></h4>



<p>Anonyome Labs is the data controller for MySudo user data. Anonyome Labs does not share MySudo user data in any form in public data sources, nor does it sell or exchange MySudo user data with any third parties. Anonyome Labs will respond to properly served requests from law enforcement agencies. See&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/government-requests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="https://anonyome.com/governmen (opens in a new tab)">https://anonyome.com/governmen</a><a href="https://anonyome.com/government-requests/">t-requests/</a>&nbsp;for more information.<br></p>



<h4><strong>What are the benefits and who will benefit?</strong></h4>



<p>Using MySudo helps a user keep their personal information private. This is achieved through the use of Sudo profiles, multiple of which can be created in order to separate different aspects of a user’s online and offline activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;Anonyome Labs benefits by providing subscription based access to the product – not from the user’s data itself.</p>



<h4><strong>What will my data be used for?</strong></h4>



<p>First and foremost, a MySudo user’s data is used to deliver the services requested. For example, when you compose and send an email from the MySudo app, the email is delivered to its intended recipients. MySudo user content, such as the content of email address or SMS messages, is never stored in a form that allows Anonyome Labs to read this content.</p>



<p>Anonyome Labs does use aggregate usage information to manage the MySudo product offering. For example, the trends in the total number of sessions, calls, messages, etc across all users are useful input to ensuring we continue to manage the health and performance of the Sudo Platform.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Protection</h3>



<h4><strong>Is my data secure?</strong></h4>



<p>Anonyome has defined security policies and operational management procedures, all of which are reviewed periodically to ensure that they continue to be effective. The Sudo Platform environment used to support MySudo users has achieved PCI DSS Level 1 certification annually since 2017.</p>



<h4><strong>Will my data be anonymous?</strong></h4>



<p>A user is not required to provide their legal identity when using most of the capabilities offered in MySudo. This provides a level of anonymity which Anonyome Labs believes is an important component of a modern Internet. There are exceptions to this when a law or regulation requires Anonyome Labs to verify a user’s legal identity, such as a financial services or telephony industry regulation.</p>



<p>We mandate that anonymous users use MySudo in a lawful and respectful way. We refer to this as “<strong>responsible anonymity</strong>”. When a user’s MySudo activity no longer meets our definition of responsible anonymity, we are committed to taking actions such as limiting or suspending use of our services and responding to legitimate requests from law enforcement agencies. We refer to this as “<strong>anonymity with recourse</strong>”.</p>



<p>Anonyome uses app analytics to understand how users use MySudo and the Sudo Platform, in order to improve these services. Data minimization principles are applied to limit which app events are collected along with what data elements are contained within those events. For example, app analytics events contain no location information — IP address or geographical representation. Analytics data that is collected is de-identified through techniques including tokenization, hashing and redaction. These techniques allow analysis for app analytics purposes without requiring the original data to be available to the analytics system.</p>



<h4><strong>Can I see and correct data about me?</strong></h4>



<p>Yes. Anonyome Labs supports certain legal rights as described in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and similar data protection regulations. For example, the right to access, the right to correction, the right to suspension of processing and the right to erasure. To exercise these rights, users may contact Anonyome Labs via email at <a href="mailto:support@anonyome.com">support@anonyome.com</a> with their request.</p>



<h3>Choice</h3>



<h4><strong>Could my data be sold?&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h4>



<p>Never. This has been a central tenet of Anonyome Labs’ ethos since we started, and is written in our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Privacy Policy (opens in a new tab)" href="https://anonyome.com/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a>. We are a for-profit company whose success is based on bringing our <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Sudo Platform (opens in a new tab)" href="https://anonyome.com/sudo-platform/" target="_blank">Sudo Platform</a> to help global brands build privacy solutions with our capabilities. For users of MySudo app, built on top of the Sudo Platform, we offer <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="paid subscriptions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://mysudo.com/mysudo-plans/" target="_blank">paid subscriptions</a> for the capabilities we offer.</p>



<h4><strong>Will I be asked for consent?</strong></h4>



<p>Almost all of the data processing that Anonyome Labs provides on behalf of MySudo users is necessary for the nature of the services that are provided, such as telephony or email communications that the user initiates. In these cases, the lawful basis for processing is to meet the legitimate interest of the MySudo user.</p>



<p>Through the MySudo app settings, a user can control their consent choices for whether anonymized app analytics information can be collected, and whether they wish to receive non-essential information from the MySudo team on using MySudo.</p>



<h3>Conclusion</h3>



<p>I hope I’ve provided an understanding of how Anonyome Labs remains true to its original ethos of empowering users to protect their private information. We’re committed to playing our role in the massive social and technological change underway in the field of consumer privacy and cyber safety.</p>
