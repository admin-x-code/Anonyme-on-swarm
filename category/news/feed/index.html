<p>The year 2022 hasn’t started well for Google, with the District of Columbia, Texas, Washington state, and Indiana <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filing a lawsuit</a> against the tech giant over “deceptive location tracking”.</p>



<h4 id="h-the-lawsuit-alleges-google-deceived-users-by-collecting-their-location-data-even-though-the-users-thought-the-function-was-disabled-these-misleading-promises-about-its-users-ability-to-protect-their-privacy-through-google-account-settings-date-back-to-at-least-2014-the-washington-post-reports">The lawsuit alleges Google deceived users by collecting their location data even though the users thought the function was disabled. These “misleading promises about its users’ ability to protect their privacy through Google account settings” date back to at least 2014, the Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/techttps:/www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/hnology/2022/01/24/google-location-data-ags-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a>. </h4>



<p></p>



<p>Commenting on the lawsuit, DC Attorney General Karl Racine <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, </p>



<h3><strong>“Google falsely led consumers to believe that changing their account and device settings would allow customers to protect their privacy and control what personal data the company could access. The truth is that contrary to Google’s representations it continues to systematically surveil customers and profit from customer data.”</strong></h3>



<p></p>



<p>That statement should drive fear through the world’s 4.66 billion internet users.</p>



<p>The lawsuit stems from investigations dating back to 2018 by Princeton University and the Associated Press into concerns that Google iOS and Android apps recorded time-stamped location data without permission.</p>



<p>As <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/01/24/google-lawsuit-location-dc-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Crunch</a> reports, “The lawsuit argues that Google created a location tracking system that’s impossible for users to opt out of and that it misled users about how privacy settings could protect their data within apps and at the device level on Android. It also accuses Google of relying on deceptive dark pattern design to force users into making choices counter to their own interests.”</p>



<p>The lawsuit seeks to stop the location data practices and fine the tech giant.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We like to bring you these stories because they highlight the extent of the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/03/how-bad-is-the-global-data-privacy-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data privacy crisis</a> and how, increasingly, privacy laws and consumer backlash are reining in big tech’s blatant disregard for user <a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/what-is-privacy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy</a>. </p>



<p>Until companies become honest stewards of consumer data, users must proactively protect themselves. At Anonyome Labs, we empower people to determine what information they share, and how, when and with whom they share it. Enterprises can use our <a href="https://sudoplatform.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo Platform</a> to rapidly develop and deploy branded privacy and cybersafety customer solutions, and consumers can use our <a href="https://mysudo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySudo</a> all-in-one privacy app. At the heart of both solutions is the <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/10/what-is-a-sudo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sudo digital identity</a>. </p>

<p>In more&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/09/china-us-recognize-national-security-risks-of-surveillance-capitalism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">news</a>&nbsp;on national&nbsp;privacy laws, post-Brexit Britain is using its newfound freedom from the EU to set its own data privacy regulatory agenda.</p>



<p>According to the country’s culture secretary,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oliver Dowden</a>, Britain could put an end to&nbsp;“irritating cookie popups and consent requests online,” and set new rules based on “common sense, not box-ticking.” New Zealand’s highly regarded privacy commissioner, John Edwards, has been appointed information commissioner to lead the change.</p>



<p>But while Britain plans to move away from the&nbsp;<a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GDPR</a>&nbsp;with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/aug/26/uk-to-overhaul-privacy-rules-in-post-brexit-departure-from-gdpr" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“world leading data policy,”</a>&nbsp;any new rules it sets will still need to protect EU-to-UK data transfers.</p>



<p>It appears that Britain wants to revert to a data protection or privacy framework that is not as strict as the GDPR and will try to redefine the appropriate balance between individual and commercial interests. Every country has a slightly different spin on that based on their history and how they arrived at their law.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A new British data privacy law could look more like the&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/06/the-california-consumer-privacy-act-and-why-you-must-still-keep-control-of-your-personal-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCPA</a>. It will be interesting to see where it lands.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In more good news for&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">data privacy legislation</a>&nbsp;in the US, the Colorado Legislature&nbsp;<a href="https://iapp.org/news/a/colorado-privacy-act-passes-professionals-ponder-effects/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed the&nbsp;<em>Colorado Privacy Act</em></a>&nbsp;(CPA) on June 8, 2021.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Colorado joins&nbsp;<a href="https://anonyome.com/2021/02/privacy-regulations-are-picking-up-pace/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California and Virginia</a>&nbsp;in having comprehensive privacy legislation.</p>



<p>Like the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Consumer Privacy Act</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://lis.virginia.gov/cgi-bin/legp604.exe?211+sum+SB1392" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act</a>, the CPA gives consumers some significant rights to control their personal data:</p>



<ul><li>Consumers will be able to opt out of the sale of personal data and the processing of their data for targeted advertising and profiling purposes. Consumers will also be able to authorize another person to opt out on their behalf.&nbsp;</li><li>Consumers will need to consent (opt in) to companies processing “sensitive” personal data, which may include information about their&nbsp;religious&nbsp;beliefs, sexual orientation, race/ethnicity, citizenship status, and physical or mental health.</li><li>Consumers will be able to request that companies delete their personal information or correct it for inaccuracies.&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>But Colorado goes further than California and Virginia in some areas; for example, by providing for:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>Rigorous limitations on secondary uses of data and the requirement for opt-in on those uses. Companies will have to state the purposes for which they’re collecting information and not change purposes later.</li><li>Banning companies from using&nbsp;<a href="https://mysudo.com/2021/02/beware-the-dark-patterns-trying-to-steal-your-data/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dark patterns</a>, which are intentional UX features of websites and apps designed to make it harder for users to do what they want, either through complexity or deception. Dark patterns are like traps to get more of users’ personal information and to tempt users into buying products and services.&nbsp;</li><li>A&nbsp;“universal” opt-out mechanism which&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thedrum.com/news/2021/06/10/why-colorado-s-privacy-bill-may-be-big-mountain-climb-marketers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">commentators</a>&nbsp;say is like the new&nbsp;<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com.au/global-privacy-control?r=US&amp;IR=T" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Global Privacy Control</a>solution. This means consumers can opt out of data collection for advertising purposes across all services at once rather than opt out separately at each site or company they access.&nbsp;</li><li>A 60-day cure period in which companies can fix any mistakes in compliance. This cure period will be phased out in January 2025.</li></ul>



<p>The CPA will apply to any organization doing business in Colorado or targeting Colorado residents with their products and services, which processes or controls the personal data of more than 100,000 consumers a year or derives revenue from selling personal data and processing or controlling the personal data of 25,000 consumers or more.</p>



<p>Fines for non-compliance can be up to $500,000.The CPA will come into effect on July 1, 2023.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>California’s Proposition 24 has just recently been passed by California voters, tightening the screws on the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">California Consumer Privacy Act 2018 (CCPA)</a>, and establishing&nbsp;a watchdog agency to oversee and enforce privacy laws.</p>



<p>Among its provisions, California Proposition 24 reins in the powers of Big Tech, preventing them from sharing consumers’ personal information and closing a loophole that meant companies could keep targeting ads with user data even when those users opted out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The passing of California Proposition 24,&nbsp;</strong><strong>also known as the California Privacy Rights Act 2020,&nbsp;</strong><strong>is a win for California consumers specifically, and privacy in the US generally.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong>The CCPA is already the most comprehensive consumer privacy law in the United States. The California Privacy Rights Act 2020 goes further.</strong></p>



<p>When it went into effect on January 1, 2020, the&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CCPA</a>&nbsp;gave consumers in California four rights over the personal information that businesses collect about them:&nbsp;</p>



<ol type="1"><li>The right to know, through a general privacy policy, what personal information a business has collected about them, where they sourced it, what they’re using it for, whether they’re disclosing or selling it, and to whom they’re disclosing or selling it.</li><li>The right to opt out of allowing a business to sell their personal information to third parties.</li><li>The right to have a business delete their personal information upon request, with some exceptions.</li><li>The right to receive equal service and pricing from a business, even if they exercise their privacy rights.</li></ol>



<p>For US residents outside California, the CCPA offers some indirect benefits if a business in scope of CCPA chooses to provide equivalent protections to all of its customers, perhaps because they are a privacy minded company or it’s simply easier to avoid differentiating based on state of residency.</p>



<p>The new California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) adds specifics to the original CCPA, and increases the penalties for non-compliance, enforced through a new state regulatory agency.</p>



<p>Specifically,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the&nbsp;CPRA:&nbsp;</p>

<h4><strong>California privacy laws raise the bar nationally.</strong></h4>



<p>A significant advantage of these Californian privacy laws is that they raise the bar on consumer privacy law nationally. Given California has a large population and is home to many large tech sector companies, the CCPA was already a reference point for ongoing discussions about <a href="https://privacyadvisorpodcast.libsyn.com/the-privacy-advisor-podcast-how-do-we-overcome-gridlock-on-us-privacy-legislation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national US legislation</a>, and it also made it easier for companies to say “California citizens have these rights so we’ll just roll out the same”. <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2019/11/11/microsoft-california-privacy-rights/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> took this approach, and Anonyome Labs does too. </p>



<h4><strong>But not all privacy professionals fully support the new California Privacy Rights Act.</strong></h4>



<p>Some observers, including the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/why-eff-doesnt-support-cal-prop-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a>, the leading nonprofit organization defending civil liberties in the digital world, and the <a href="https://www.aclunc.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACLU of Northern California</a>, believe the new legislation does not do enough to advance the data privacy of California citizens. They support the new law in spirit but are critical of some specifics. </p>



<p>One argument is that while the CPRA makes the original CCPA more <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90568584/california-privacy-rights-act-proposition-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“nuanced and expansive”</a>, it still <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90568584/california-privacy-rights-act-proposition-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favors business</a> over consumers. Opponents of the new law argue the onus remains on consumers, not companies, to protect personal data, and that there’s been a missed opportunity to implement “opt in” as opposed to “opt out” such that privacy would be the default option and companies would need to seek a customer’s explicit consent before collecting, using, sharing or storing their <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/05/what-constitutes-personally-identifiable-information-or-pii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">personal information</a>. The <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/07/why-eff-doesnt-support-cal-prop-24" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EFF argues</a> the new data minimization provisions don’t go far enough, and that companies can refuse consumer requests to delete their personal information under some circumstances. </p>



<p>In a statement, the <a href="https://dot.la/cpra-2648639901.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ACLU said</a> the new law has “deep flaws” but “sends a clear message from California voters to the California legislature that they expect and demand action to protect their privacy and safeguard their fundamental privacy rights.”</p>



<h4><strong>What Anonyome Labs thinks about the new law</strong></h4>



<p>We acknowledge the arguments of both sides of the privacy community and hope that the spirited debate among privacy leaders does not get in the way of progress. In our recent <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/where-will-privacy-be-in-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Visions of privacy post</a>, we outlined our hope that by 2030 corporate social responsibility for data processing would be codified into systems design. By the end of this decade, we envision a reality wherein customers’ collective feedback has an immediate effect on a business’ use of personal data. Data protection is explicitly part of system design and elements like data retention and uses of customer data are well controlled. Those controls can be tightened or loosened more easily based on changes in regulation, punishments by regulators for failing to do the right thing, or feedback from customers on how they think their data is being treated.  </p>



<p>We believe the California Privacy Rights Act 2020 is a good step forward because its overall measures strengthen the CCPA and it also offers another proof point for national legislators. Even though there’s little material progress on a national privacy law (yet), this next step in California sends a clear message that <a href="https://anonyome.com/2020/09/what-are-consumers-saying-about-privacy-and-safety/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privacy matters to consumers</a>. We are always of the mind that some improvements are better than none.</p>
