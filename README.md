**You want to know how to do yours also right!. Just follow along...**

  <li>The First thing you need to do is install and run your personal swarm bee node.
    Documentation on how to do that can be found here https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/installation/quick-start (i will advise you to use MAC or LINUX)
  <li> When your node is ready, fund it with BZZ and xDAI. All the instructions about that can be found here. https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/

Now you are ready to upload and host your website on the swarm decentralized storage. I used the instructions here: https://docs.ethswarm.org/docs/access-the-swarm/upload-a-directory

To publish an existing blog, the easiest way for me is to:
    Mirror the website using 
    ```
    $wget -m -np -k "url"
    ```
    The wget is used for retrieving files (Remember to follow fair data society principle)
    -np is not include parent directory (since all we need is the blog)
    -k is for downloading all js,css, and any other prerequisites
    and then the url.
    
  After i downloaded all i need, i edited the code in order for it to function properly.
    and then published on SWARM. This is the result below.
